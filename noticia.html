                    <p class="texto"> Crowds waited for Lewis’ body at the foot of the bridge, where he was met by
                        Alabama state
                        troopers,
                        who
                        safely escorted him across and on to the state capitol.

                        “His final march, that final crossing, so different than the first, speaks to the legacy that he
                        leaves
                        behind and the lives that he changed,” Sewell said. "It’s poetic justice that this time, Alabama
                        state
                        troopers will see John to his safety. "


                        As the horse-drawn caisson approached the bridge, those in the masses on the sidewalk could be
                        heard
                        singing for Lewis. In an emotional moment, the voices stopped as Lewis' casket began to make its
                        way
                        across the bridge in silent reverence.

                        Lewis, who died earlier this month at the age of 80, made his last journey across the Edmund
                        Pettus
                        Bridge with only his family to join him.

                        Lewis' son, brothers and sister followed behind the caisson along Lewis' longtime chief of staff
                        wearing
                        shirts emblazoned with the words "Good Trouble," a nod to Lewis' view on activism.

                        The 16-term lawmaker, often called the conscience of Congress, was a giant of the civil
                        rights
                        movement of the 1960s. Lewis was only 25 when he believed Alabama troopers would kill him on
                        the
                        peaceful march for voting rights across the bridge on March 7, 1965, known today as “Bloody
                        Sunday.”

                        Lewis suffered a fractured skull and was one of dozens of nonviolent protesters who were
                        hospitalized. News coverage of the brutal beatings prompted increased pressure on Congress
                        to
                        pass
                        the 1965 Voting Rights Act, to bar states from enforcing discriminatory laws that had long
                        hindered
                        prospective Black voters.

                        And though Lewis is possibly best known for his march in Selma, he had already emerged as a
                        leading
                        voice in the fight for equal rights and had been arrested a number of times for the cause by
                        that
                        time.
